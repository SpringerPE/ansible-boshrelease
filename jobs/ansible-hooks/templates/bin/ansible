# The purpose of this script is initialize the ansible enviroment to be able
# to call ansible binaries from other jobs, for example to include in
# pre/post start/deploy scripts.
#
# Example call from a post-start script:
#
# /var/vcap/jobs/ansible/run -i my-inventory my-playbook.yml

set -e # exit immediately if a simple command exits with a non-zero status
set -u # report the usage of uninitialized variables

# Setup env vars and folders for the ctl script
source /var/vcap/jobs/ansible-hooks/packages/ansible/_helpers/setup.sh "ansible-hooks"

# Load ansible environment variables. You can predefine the
# ANSIBLE_CONFIG variable to point to your own custom configuration
source /var/vcap/jobs/ansible-hooks/data/env.sh

# Load function lib
source /var/vcap/jobs/ansible-hooks/packages/ansible/_helpers/lib.sh

# Load python library path for dynamic libs
ldconf "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

# Run it. By defining the environment variable RUN you can choose
# which ansible binary you want to run. It defaults to "ansible-playbook"
RUN="${RUN:-ansible-playbook}"
exec /var/vcap/jobs/ansible-hooks/packages/ansible/bin/${RUN} "$@"
